## General Information
When it comes to protecting your personal information against cyberattacks, the first line of defense is a strong, unique password.  This generator will create that for you.  Just remember to write it down somewhere safe (unless you have a really good memory).

When opening the page, you will be greeted with the following.  All you have to do is click on "Generate Password", and you will be taken to the next step, criteria selection.

## Criteria Selection
The more complex your password is, the more secure your information will be.  That's where criteria selection comes into play.  You are given the option to select both length and character type through a series of prompts. 

After you hit the "Generate Password" button, the first question will ask you how many characters you would like your password to be.  See below:

If you enter a number outside that range, you will receive an error message.  Also, you must type in a number in the form of a number.  Typing it out will make you restart.

Once you have selected a length, you will get to choose what type(s) of characters to include in your password.  The following are your choices:

a) Uppercase Letters\
b) Lowercase Letters\
c) Special Characters (&,#,$, etc)\
d) Numbers

The prompts will look like the one below:
